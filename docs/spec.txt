PyWebApps
=========

This describes, somewhat pedantically and in a non-helpful order,
parts of what makes up a PyWebApp.  Known-open-questions are marked
with "FIXME".

Process Initialization
----------------------

This is the process that the container must go through when
starting/activating an application.

You should instantiate ``app = pywebapp.PyWebApp()``

Then you should create the settings module with
``app.setup_settings()``.  This creates a module ``websettings``.

Next you must activate all the services.  This is something your tool
itself must do.  At its most basic you do::

    websettings.add_setting(service_name, settings)

For example::

    websettings.add_setting('mysql', {'username': 'root', ...})

This creates a value ``websettings.mysql`` (but the function does
other checks for validity).  There are some helpers you can use (in
``pywebapp.services``), but these are a convenience to you.

**After** you have setup the services you call ``app.activate_path()``
to set ``sys.path``.  This also may import code that uses settings, so
it is important to setup services first.

Get the app from ``app.wsgi_app``

Process Configuration
---------------------

The ``websettings`` module contains configuration from the
host/container of the application that is being sent to the
application.  Anything can go in here, including ad hoc settings, but
some settings are expected.

websettings.config_dir:
    The path to the configuration (a directory).  May be None.  Must
    be set.

websettings.canonical_hostname:
    The "base" hostname.  The application may be on a wildcard domain
    or something like that, but this is at least one hostname that
    will point back to the application.  It may be the only hostname.
    This like the Host header: ``domain:port``.

websettings.canonical_scheme:
    The expected scheme, generally either ``http`` or ``https``.
    ``environ['wsgi.url_scheme']`` also of course must be set.
    Generally this is set to https when the container is forcing all
    requests to be https.

websettings.log_dir:
    A path where log files can be written.  It is simply writable, and
    is entirely under control of the application.  (FIXME: maybe a
    couple names here could be reserved by the container?  Or... maybe
    best not?)

Also some environmental context should be set properly:

current directory:
    Must be the application root

``$TEMP``:
    A temporary directory.  This should be application-private, and as
    such a suitable place to put cache files and the like.  The
    container should try to clear this out at appropriate times (like
    an update).

Also expect that over time specific settings will be documented and
validated by this module.  E.g., the contents of ``websettings.mysql``
may be standardized specifically.

FIXME: some "version" of this specifically itself should go in here,
and also be possible to require or request in the application
description.

Application Description
-----------------------

Configuration files are generally YAML throughout the system.  The
application description is in the root of the application directory,
and is called ``app.yaml``.

app_platform:
    This is the basic platform of the application.  ``wsgi`` is the
    only value we've thought through.  Something like Tornado requires
    the server itself to be run, an application entry point doesn't
    work; it would be another kind of platform (e.g.,
    ``python-server``?)

runner:
    A Python file.  It does not need to be importable, and may have
    for example ``-`` in its name, or use an extension like ``.wsgi``
    instead of ``.py``.

    This file when exec'd should produce a global variable
    ``application``.  This is a WSGI application.

add_paths:
     A single path or a list of paths that should be added to
    ``sys.path``.  All paths will get priority over system-wide paths,
    and ``.pth`` files will be interpreted.  Also if a
    ``sitecustomize.py`` file exists in any path it will be exec'd.
    Multiple ``sitecustomize.py`` files may be exec'd!  By default
    ``lib/pythonX.Y``, ``lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages``, and
    ``lib/python`` will be loaded.  It is best to just use the last
    (``lib/python``).

static_path:
    A path that will contain static files.  These will be available
    *at the root* of the application, so if you do ``static_path:
    static/`` then ``static/favicon.ico`` will be available at the URL
    path ``/favicon.ico``.  If you want a file at, for instance,
    ``/static/blank.gif`` you must put it in
    ``static/static/blank.gif``.

    This value defaults to ``static/``

    FIXME: there should be a way to set mimetypes

require_py_version:
    Indicates the Python versions supported.  (FIXME: just
    Setuptools-style requirement, e.g., >=2.7,<3.0 ?)

require_platform:
    This is the hosting platform you require (a list of options).
    Generally ``posix`` and ``win`` are the options.

deb:
    These are settings specific to Debian and Ubuntu systems.

deb.packages:
    Packages that should be installed on Debian/Ubuntu systems.

rpm:
    Values specific to RPM-like systems (Redhat, CentOS, etc).

rpm.packages:
    Packages that should be installed on RPM-based systems.  (FIXME:
    often specific packages are needed, and there isn't a central
    repository).  (FIXME: maybe we should allow ``rpm.requirements``
    being a ``requirements.txt`` file containing anything that isn't
    available in a package, but less than the global ``requirements``
    file?)

requirements:
    A path to a pip ``requirements.txt`` file.  (FIXME: does deb/rpm
    configuration takes precedence over this?  Or do we just make sure
    those packages are installed first, so that any already-met
    requirements don't then need to be reinstalled?)

config:
    This relates to configuration that the application requires.  This
    is for applications that are not self-configured.  Configuration
    is simply a directory, which may contain one or more files, in any
    format, to be determined by the application itself.

    Note that configuration should be things that a deployer might
    want to change in some useful fashion.  E.g., a blog title.

config.required:
    If true then configuration is required.

config.template:
    This is a template for creating a valid configuration (which the
    deployer may then edit).  What kind of template is not yet
    defined.

    Probably it would contain some kind of structured description of
    what parameters the template requires, and then a routine that
    given the parameters will create a directory structure.

config.checker:
    This checks a configuration for validity (presumably after the
    deployer edits it).  This is a command.  Not fully defined.

config.default:
    This is a relative path which points to the default configuration
    if one is not given.  If this value is provided then
    ``config.required`` won't really matter, as the application will
    always have at least its default configuration.

services:
    This contains a number of named services.  It is up to the
    container to interpret these and setup the services.  (FIXME:
    clearly this needs to be expanded.)

Commands
--------

Several configuration values are "commands", that is: something that
can be executed.  All commands are run in the activated environment
(i.e., after ``sys.path`` has been updated, and with service
configuration).

Commands take one of several formats:

URL:
    This is a URL that will be fetched.  It may be fetched through an
    artificial WSGI request (i.e., not over-the-wire HTTP).

    A URL starts with ``url:`` or simply anything that starts with
    ``/``.  E.g., ``/__heartbeat__`` indicates a request to that URL.
    FIXME: also there should be a way to tell that it is being called
    as a command, not as an external URL (e.g., special environ key).

Python script:
    This is a script that will be run.  It will be run with
    ``execfile()``, and in it ``__name__ == '__main__'``, so any
    normal script can be used.

    A Python script starts with ``pyscript:`` or any path that *does
    not* start with ``/`` and ends in ``.py``.  All paths of course
    are relative to the root of the application.

General script:
    This is a script that is run in a subprocess, and could be for
    instance a shell script.  FIXME: we would need to define the
    environment?

    The script will be run with the current working directory of the
    application root.  It will be run with something akin to
    ``os.system()``, i.e., as a shell script.

    General scripts must start with ``script:``.

Python functions:
    This is a function to be called.  The function cannot take any
    arguments.

    A Python function must start with ``pyfunc:`` and have either a
    complete dotted-notation path, or ``module:object.attr``
    (Setuptools-style).  Also anything that does not start with ``/``
    and is contains only valid Python identifiers and ``.`` will
    automatically be considered a Python function.

Commands can only generally return success or failure, plus readable
messages.  The failure case is specific:

* For URLs, 2xx is success, all other status is a failure.  Output is
  the body of the response.

* For a Python script, calling ``SystemExit`` (or ``sys.exit()``) with
  a non-zero code is failure, an exception is failure, otherwise it is
  success.  The output is what is printed to ``sys.stdout`` and
  ``sys.stderr``.

* For a General script, exit code and stdout/stderr.

* For a Python function, an exception is a failure, all else is
  success.  Output is stdout/stderr or a string return value (if both,
  the string is appended to output).  (FIXME: non-string, truish
  return value?)

The command environment for scripts should be:

``$PYWEBAPP_LOCATION``:
  This environmental variable points to the application root.

current directory:
  This also should(?) be at the application root.

In the case of exceptions, the output value is preserved and the
``str()`` of the exception is added.  (FIXME: also the traceback?)

It may be sensible to allow a combination of a rich object (e.g.,
response with headers, list of interleaved stdout/stderr, etc) and a
string fallback.

FIXME: General scripts and URLs can implicitly have arguments (URLs
having the query string), but the others can't (maybe Python scripts
also can have arguments?).  Maybe we should allow shell-quoted
arguments to all commands (except URLs).

Events/hooks
------------

At different stages of an application's deployment lifecycle

install:
    Called when an application is first installed.  This would be the
    place to create database tables, for instance.

before_update:
    Called before an update is applied.  This is called in the context
    of the previous installation/version.

update:
    Called when an application is updated, called after the update in
    the context of the new version.

before_delete:
    Called before deleting an application.

ping:
    Called to check if an application is alive; must be low in
    resource usage.  A URL is most preferable for this parameter.

health_check:
    Called to check if an application is in good shape.  May do
    integrity checks on data, for instance.  May be high in resource
    usage.

config.validator:
    Called to check if the configuration is valid.

check_environment:
    Can be called to confirm that the environment is properly
    configured, for instance to check that all necessary command-line
    programs are available.  This check is optional, the environment
    need not run it.

If only one of ``install`` or ``update`` are defined, then they are
used interchangeably.  E.g., if ``install`` is defined, it is called
on updates.  Or if only ``update`` is defined, it is called on install.

Kinds of Services
-----------------

Services are things the provider provides, and can represent a variety
of things.  All application state must be represented through
services.  As such you can't do much of interest without at least some
services.

files
~~~~~

This represents just a place to keep files.  The files don't do
anything, they are to be read and written by the application.

The configuration looks like::

    websettings.files = {'dir': <directory>}

You can write to this directory.  An optional key ``"quota"`` is the
most data you are allowed to put in this directory (in bytes).

public_files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a place to keep files that you want served up.  These files
take precedence over your own application!

The directory layout starts with the domain of the request, or
``default`` for any/all domains.  So if you want to write out a file
that will be served up in ``/user-content/public.html`` then write it
to ``<public_files>/default/user-content/public.html``

Note that this has obvious security concerns, so you should write
things carefully.

Configuration looks like::

    websettings.public_files = {"dir": <directory>}

``"quota"`` is also supported.

Databases
~~~~~~~~~

Several databases act similarly.

The configuration parameters that are generally necessary are kept in
a dictionary with these keys:

host:
  The host that the database is on (e.g., ``"localhost"``)

port:
  The port of the database

dbname:
  The name of the database (e.g., ``db_1234``)

user:
  The user to connect as.  May be None.

password:
  The password to connect with.  May be None.

low_security_user:
  Entirely optional, this is a second user that could be created for
  use during runtime (as opposed to application setup).  This user
  might not have permission to create or delete tables, for instance.

low_security_password:
  Accompanying password.
